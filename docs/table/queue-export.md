# Queue Export

If you are working with lots of data, it's recommended to enable Queue Export.

Queue export will divide your records into batches, increasing the export performance.

For instance, if you have 1 million records, you may set up 10 queues. Each batch will contain a total of 100,000 records.

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
 Queues only take effect when exporting ALL records. If you have manually selected some records, they will be exported in a single batch.

## Get started

To enable queue export, you must configure the methods by calling the Facade Exportable within the setUp method.

- `->queues()`: Number of queues to be used.
- `->onQueue()`: Queue name. If blank, `default` will be used.
- `->onConnection()`: Connection. Read more in [Laravel Queue Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/queues#introduction).
- public property `$showExporting`: Show the export progress on the screen if `true` (default).

Example:

```php
class DishesTable extends PowerGridComponent
{

    public function setUp()
    {
        return [
            Exportable::make('export')
               ->striped()
               ->type(Exportable::TYPE_XLS, Exportable::TYPE_CSV)
               ->queues(6)
               ->onQueue('my-dishes')
               ->onConnection('redis'),
        ];
    }

  //...
```

## Back-end

You can manipulate the state of processing in the back-end:

```php
public function onBatchThen(Batch $batch): void
{
    // All jobs completed successfully...
    // TODO notify user!
}

public function onBatchCatch(Batch $batch, Throwable $e): void
{
   // First batch job failure detected...
   // TODO add to failure log.
}

public function onBatchFinally(Batch $batch): void
{
   // The batch has finished executing...  
   // TODO add to success log.
}
```

---

## Front-end

```php
public function onBatchExecuting(Batch $batch): void
{
    // send alert

   if ($batch->finished()) {
       $this->dispatchBrowserEvent('batch-finished', $batch);
       
       return;
   } 
   
   $this->dispatchBrowserEvent('batch-executing', $batch);
}
```
